# Library Management System

This Library Management System is a console-based application developed in C++. It allows for the management of a library's books and students, including adding new books, displaying book details, registering students, issuing books to students, and returning books. This system is designed to be user-friendly, with a clear and attractive console interface.

## Features

- **Create Book**: Add new books to the library system with details such as book number, quantity, name, author, and publication.
- **Show Book**: Display the details of a book by entering its book number.
- **Create Student**: Register a new student with their name and admission number.
- **Issue Book**: Issue a book to a student, updating the system's records.
- **Return Book**: Mark a book as returned, making it available for issue again.
- **Exit**: Safely exit the Library Management System application.
